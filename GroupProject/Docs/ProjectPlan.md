# Project Plan

**Author**:Team61

## 1 Introduction

The team will deliver a software application (**GroceryListManager**) that provides functionality for management of grocery lists which includes the  addition, deletion, selection and renaming of a grocery lists. Selection of items within the grocery list and quantity required. Finally check marking and clearing of check marks for items which have been purchased.

## 2 Process Description

Our team (61) will be utilizing the waterfall model for the development of the software.

### 2.1 Determine Requirements

**Activity name: Determine Requirements**

The purpose of this activity is to make sure all requirements support the project's use case.   This activity includes defining functional, non-functional, and users requirements.

**Activity description**

Formally document user requirements set forth by Brad and Janet as well as brainstorming among members of Team61 for other system requirements.

**Entrance criteria**

The basis of the requirements stems from the requirements document posted in T-Square. Those requirements state: Brad and Janet, are interested in developing **GroceryListManager**  Android application. To achieve this goal, they are interested in hiring a team of developers that can develop the GroceryListManage, that provides functionality for management of grocery lists which includes the  addition, deletion, selection and renaming of a grocery lists. Selection of items within the grocery list and quantity required. Finally check marking and clearing of check marks for items which have been purchased.

**Exit criteria**

A signed-off requirements document. (This step may not be applicable since we do not have a live person to receive a sign-off from). An output of this process would be the scope of the project that needs to be undertaken by Team61.


### 2.2 Design

**Activity name: Design**

The design process will allow us to determine and establish a software architecture that will fit within the Team61-defined requirements.

**Activity description**

To develop a design framework for the project based on functional and supplementary requirements (non-functional) requirements documentation.

**Entrance criteria**

Based on the user requirements provided by Brad & Janet (inputs) and the analyses work performed by Team61, a set of design documents have been developed.

Use Cases, Use case model, and associated UML model as well as a supplementary requirements (non-functional requirements document) will define the software architecture which Team61 can work to develop that is functional, maintainable and can be easily ran by any user.

The design will be validated via design review by Team61. Details of the overall system and steps required for implementation will be discussed.

**Exit criteria**

Once Team61 agrees that the design presented at the design review meets all requirements set forth by the Brad & Janet and Team61.  The project can proceed to the implementation phase.


### 2.3 Construction

**Activity name: Construction**

The purpose of this exercise is to develop the working solution that meets the requirements and specification of the software as set forth by Brad & Janet and Team61.

**Activity description**

The task of this phase is to develop the software code as per design and requirements. As pieces of the source code are completed, they can be checked into GitHub for the Team61 members to review.

**Entrance criteria**

The Entry criteria of this phase would be a completed and verified design document which is in-line with the function and non-functional requirements. (Input)

Once the source code has been completed, Team61 can perform a source code review where the source code, including associated unit (J-Unit) tests, are reviewed to ensure they meet the system requirements.

**Exit criteria**

Once a source code review has been performed, and Team61 believes that the source is functional, complete and meets all requirements, the verification process can begin. An output from the implementation phase is a completed source-code for the software application as well as (potentially) associated unit (J-Unit) tests.

### 2.4 Testing

**Activity name: Testing**

The purpose of this process is to ensure that the software is functioning as expected by not only making sure all unit (J-Unit), integration and system tests are passing as expected, but also that documentation is up-to-date and meets requirements.

**Activity description**

This phase is also known as verification & validation (V&V) testing. Test cases are executed here to ensure the software will not break and will only provide information that is expected, no matter what set of positive and negative data is entered.

During this process, the Quality Assurance & Documentation managers will oversee the review process to ensure the testing is complete and all test cases have been executed.

**Entrance criteria**

Team61 can begin the testing process once the source code (input) is complete.


**Exit criteria**

Once Team61 agrees that the software meets all requirements, the project can be closed and transitioned to the 'maintenance phase'.

### 2.5 Maintenance

**Activity name: Maintenance**

The purpose of the 'Maintenance' process is to maintain the source code once it has been handed off and completed. There may be needs, later on down the road, to implement new features or possibly fix bugs that were not previously identified or arise from the implementation of new features.

**Activity description**

Requests for modification need to be implemented in this phase. Changes can arise from User functionality change, environment change ( system upgrades), or non functional changes (performance improvements). All modifications to the delivered code must through all the testing phases to ensure no negative impact to the system.

**Entrance criteria**

The entry criteria for this step is tested and delivered  software. At this point, all requests for modification processes management must be followed to make any changes to production code.


**Exit criteria**

The maintenance phase remains ongoing until the software is retired.

## 3 Team

 **Team members**

- Robert Yankou (ryankou3)
- Myles Lefkovitz (gth836x)
- Emmanuel Thomas (ethomas32)
- Shahram Amid (samid3)

**Roles**

- **Project Manager:** This person in this role is in charge of managing the overall process of the delivering the software. This includes making sure roles are assigned, requirements are defined, processes are followed according to the documentation and specification, and the project is completed within the constraints of scope.

- **Development Manager:** This person is in charge of developing a well-defined system architecture that conforms to the system requirements defined by Team61 and making sure the implementation of that design is done so according to specification.

- **Documentation Manager:** The documentation manager is responsible for ensuring the requirements documentation meets the user-requirements set forth by the customer (Brad & Janet) but also making sure that all documentation is well-defined and explicit.

- **Quality Assurance Manager:** The individual in this role is tasked with ensuring that all testing is run and pass as well as all documentation is up to date and complete.
